This is a policy page. 

--enable/disable--
shownewconnect:NO

--directives--
showip:NO
showalias:NO
showts:YES

Notes:
1. the SHOWIP directive has been removed, and the license terms state that you cannot change the software to make it work.
2. [this is also broken don't do this] all of the directives take YES or NO, except for showts, which has a third choice called LOCAL, which allows users to choose to enable or disable Timestamps.
3. if one or more of the directives is YES, the shownewconnect directive also has to be YES.

DO NOT SET MULTIPLE VALUES FOR ONE DIRECTIVE. YOU HAVE TO SET THIS UP RIGHT OR THIS WON'T WORK.
