[CELEBRATING ONE (1) YEAR: This project is now one year old and has come farther than I had anticipated.]

There are many ways to interpret Chatbox Engine:
- remote file system
- proxy for information transfer via HTTP
- communication service

but the basic concept stays the same:
- chatboxes are opened which are special files
- users can write, read, upload files, etc.
- users granted permissions and using their logins can also delete, append, etc.
- addons and additional scripts can be added to the working directory and set up to execute on certain actions (like message send).
- a somewhat complicated yet powerful API is in place to allow end users to do as they please.

- by default, an IRC-like client that makes use of the API comes prepackaged. this is because the original version of Chatbox Engine
was used to evade school web filters and enable communication.
