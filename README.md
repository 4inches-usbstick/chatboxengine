Premise
- chatboxes are opened which can be plain text or special files with special encodings
- each chatbox has a directory attached to it where anyone can upload
- some users can be granted permissions, such as editing or deleting. 
- addons and additional scripts can be added to the working directory and set up to execute on certain actions (like message send or login).
- an API allows for external access

Notes
- also comes with a "client" that lets you write to files one line at a time like an IRC client. this is because the original version was optimized for communication on school internet (where lots of other websites are blocked and connections are limited in speed).
