HOW TO CHANGE YOUR REFRESH RATE:

The refresh rate determines how often the server should ask the server if anything new has happened within a Chatbox. The less the refresh rate, the more often the client asks the server.
No Update / Manual Update is any non-integer or non-float number (grab new meesages only when the user tells the client to)

You can change it wherever there's a slot for 'RR' or 'refreshrate'.
