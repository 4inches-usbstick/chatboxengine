HOW TO CHANGE YOUR REFRESH RATE:

The refresh rate determines how often the server should ask the server if anything new has happened within a Chatbox. The less the refresh rate, the more often the client asks the server.

Normal is about 3000ms (grab new messages every 3 seconds)
Default is 30000 (grab new messages every 30 seconds)
No Update / Manual Update is any non-integer or non-float number (grab new meesages only when the user tells the client to)
