READ ME 

This Read Me has the instructions for setting up Chatbox Engine for your server. 

--PART ZERO: PRE REQS--
You need the following things:

-an HTTP server (the OG CBE is hosted on Apache, use what you want)
-PHP 7.3 (yes, this specific version. other versions may work, but will be unstable and require modification come the next PHP update.)
-A C++ compiler (the OG CBE uses MSVC 2017. this may or may not apply to you.) This is required to run PHP 7.3. It's recomneded that you read up on the aforementioned things before going ahead.
-a web browser for testing
-a text editor with a Find and Replace feature
-internet

Make sure to read and understand the license before using


--PART ONE: INSTALLATION--
Do this on a non-mobile device. 

You'll need to create a directory named textengine on the server. Not in any subfolders or other things, it needs to be its own parent directory.
Inside your new textengine directory, create another folder named sitechats. From there, copy the ZIP file from its home into the sitechats. 
Unzip the ZIP file so all of the contents end up in sitechats. Do not delete any files, especially remote management files, inchat files, any of the subfolders in sitechats, or Integration Interface files.

Also, get rid of the home buttons. These are in joinchatpublic, createnewchat and terminal documents. Look for the <a> element and remove the one that says "Go back to home" or simply "Home". Alternatively, create your own homepage and link to that.

Verify your installation. Turn your HTTP server on and go to this filepath:

http://[your IP or domain name]/textengine/sitechats/inchat.php. A page should come up, but it shouldn't be fully functional. If you can't get the page to open, you've misconfigured
something.

Make sure .hta files are protected by your server, because they hold things that people aren't supposed to be able to interact with.

--PART TWO: ADAPTION--
After installing. You need to adapt it to your server. Open all of the files (yes, even the ones in media, data, and other directories) with the *.php file extension in a text editor with a Find and Replace function.
Find all instances of a certain string and change it accordingly.



STRING;
CHANGE INTO.

71.255.240.10:8080                 
(your servers IP or domain name, with port number)

71.255.240.10:8080/textengine/map.html
the URL to your index page

C:/wamp64/www/textengine/          
this depends on your OS and server software, but change it to the path you would use to open these files on your local machine.

C:/wamp64/www/.htaaccess                                    
the path you would take to get to an htaccess file

fwrite($f1, "deny from $_GET[params]");                         
replace the second parameter with what you would write in to ban someone by IP

header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');                     
if there are CORS policy issues, change this within the files to something else.

line 233-252 of terminalprocess                 
the correct shell command

America/New_york
change that into the correct PHP timezone

Try all the functions:
-create new chat
-join chat
-upload small image file
-send commands to Terminal


The last steps are to change the server operator / admin password, as well as set some policies:

1. open .htapassword in your new sitechats directory and change the password to literally anything else.
2. open .htaconnectionpolicy (do this only if you know what this is), and change directives to match what you want.
3. If you don't want to be able to load extensions with the terminal, then you can take out this snippet in terminalprocess:

if ($_GET["cmd"] == "loadexe" and $_GET["pass"] == $pass) { 
	$contents = file_get_contents("loader.py");
	$newcontents = str_replace('%%replace01', $_GET['params'], $contents);
	unlink('loader-tmp.py');
	$f = fopen('loader-tmp.py', 'w');
	fwrite($f, $newcontents);
	fclose($f);
	echo("<b>Script loaded.</b><br>");
	
	$f = fopen('.htaremotedesktop', 'w');
	fwrite($f, 'shell;start C:/wamp64/www/textengine/sitechats/loader-tmp.py');
	fclose($f);
	echo("<b>Script execution started.</b><br>");
	print_r($output);
}
(make sure to change the help section too, as well as delete rdc-modded.py)


Now, we have these things called extensions. You can download them from http://71.255.240.10:8080/textengine/downloads/extensions/gallerydy.php.
Getting extensions is as simple as getting the ZIP file, unzipping it somewhere, and doing some config. Extensions are scripts that change the behavior of CBE, either by adding onto or replacing existing files.


More Things:

-> For an API-send only configuration, delete inchat.php and friends. That way, people can read Chatboxes, but cannot send them without the API.
-> If you want any API file to be password protected, add this code to the beginning of the API pages:


if ($_GET['key'] != $yourpassword) {
header('HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden');
die();
}

-> Chatbox Engine can be used for a lot of things. You only have to make it what you want.



oh and also remember to change your password regularly
