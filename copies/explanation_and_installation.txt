INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
This Read Me has the instructions for setting up Chatbox Engine for your server. 

--PART ZERO: PRE REQS--
You need the following things:

-an HTTP server 
-PHP 7.3 
-A C++ compiler 
-text editor
-web browser

Make sure to read and understand the license before using Chatbox Engine.


--Initial Config--
You'll need to create a directory named textengine on the server. Not in any subfolders or other things, it needs to be its own parent directory.
Inside your new textengine directory, create another folder named sitechats. From there, copy the files and subdirectories into the sitechats dir.

Now, open .htamainpolicy with your favorite text editor and change these things in the config file:

Change 71.255.240.10:8080 to the IP or domain of your server.
Change C:/wamp64/www/textengine to the path that you would take to get to your textengine directory. No slash on the end.
Change C:/wamp64/www/textengine/sitechats/copies to the location where you want Chatboxes to be copied when using the XCOPY command.
Change C:/wamp64/www/textengine/sitechats/copies to the location where you want Media directories to be copied when using the MCOPY command.
Change America/New_York to the PHP timezone your server uses.
Change 12582912 to the max number of bytes you want a person to be able to upload to the server. Note that this does not bypass your server's POST limits and whatnot.
Change policies with IDs 25 and 27 with the file that handles banned IPs and what you would input to ban an IP, respectively (for example: 25=.htamainpolicy and 27=deny from %ip).**
Change PID 29 if you want to ban certain words from being used. For each word, use '//' after (// is the delimiter between words).
Change PID 31 to protect system files with certain extensions. For each extension, use '//' after it. 

For these policies, YES and NO (case sensitive) are the only acceptable values:

PID 13: yes for allow media upload universally, no for forbid media upload universally.
PID 15: yes if you want to enable the LOADEXE command, no if you want to disable the LOADEXE command.
PID 17: yes if you want people to create their own filenames on upload, no if you want to have uploaded files automatically renamed.
PID 19: yes if you want to use inchat_joinpage, no if you want to use joinchatpublic.
PID 21: yes if you want the API to be enabled, and no if you want everything to break. Note that this option does not affect the Terminal.
PID 23: yes if you want the rule.Timestamps(1) feature, no if you want that feature disabled universally.
PID 33: yes if you want encoder conversions, no if you want to disable encoding conversions.

--CBauth--
To add someone to the CBauth list, use this format:

#::Alias::Password::Permissions;

Number is the UID. This number must start from 1 and go up one by one.
Alias is the name that is tied to the UID.
Password (a.k.a. the UKEY) is the password tied to the UID,
Permissions is the permission level this user has (either sudo or notsudo).

CBauth is used to verify certain usernames when sending messages and issuing Terminal/Edit (TerminEdit) commands.
For issuing TerminEdit commands, use the UID and UKEY slots to verify your identity (and don't enter the password that TerminEdit commands usually want).
For sending messages with a protected username, enter the web client with the protected username, then enter the correct UID and UKEY in the web client. Any messages you send are now under the protected
username. If you try to use a protected username without the proper credentials, you will be stopped and your request to send a message will be denied.

Notes:
1. Make sure to credit me and others by linking to credits.cbedata.
2. Make sure your server protects all files ending in '.hta'
3. (**) from earlier: use %ip to show where you would put the IP to ban
