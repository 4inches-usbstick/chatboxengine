Looking for the CBEDATA docs?
See cbedata.txt

If you choose to use the Python CBEDATA interpreter, here's the documentation.
Read the CBEDATA docs before.


--Functions--
There are two functions you can call:

1. get_offline_obj
2. get_offline



--Syntax--

Both functions have the same parameters: file, path, type.

1. file is where to get the data from. this is a string with CBEDATA in it.
2. path is the path within the CBEDATA file you want (for example: main-people-numberofpeople)
3. type is the format you want your data back in.

--Non-Object Function--
In the NOF, these formats are available (these formats go into the type argument):

1. cls gets the entire subclass
2. raw gets all the data for you to play with
3. val gets the value of the attribute you called
4. var gets the name and value of the attribute you called in this format: attrib-name==attrib-value

The function will return as a string.

--Object Function--
In the OF, these formats are available:

1. raw gives you back subclass as a string, however, the 'class[classname>' is gone, unlike the other raw
2. list-val gives you all the attribute values in a subclass as a list.
3. list-key gives you all the attribute names in a subclass as a list
4. dic gives you a Python dictionary with the keys being the attribute names and the values being the attribute values.
