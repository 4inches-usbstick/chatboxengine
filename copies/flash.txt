<inchat, inchatntfs, inchat4html trigger warning>
Your client 'polls' the server. Every few seconds, your client will ask the server for new messages. When the new messages are loaded in for people to see, it causes a brief flash in the area where the messages appear. This applies to both HTML chatboxes and Legacy chatboxes. 

If you are sensitive to flashes, take precautions such as slowing down the polling rate.
