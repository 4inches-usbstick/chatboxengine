-----------------------------------------

Notes:
1. All filepaths must use '/'
2. Boolean values must have YES or NO
3. Only use no-go-phrases if certain words would threaten user security (i.e. <script> tag)
4. On no-go-phrases and protect-extensions: use '//' as the delimiter between phrases.
5. PERMS within the CBauth section must be sudo or notsudo, where sudo allows users to run admin commands and perform admin actions. All users in CBauth will be granted a reserved name.
6. RESRICT-TO in FILESAFE has three options: local, sudo and login. local means no writing is allowed through the API, sudo means you have to be a sudo user to write to the file, and login means you just have to log in to write to the file.
7. WHile CBauth needs semicolons at the end of each entry, FILESAFE does not, it just needs '::'.
8. PID 37 is specifically for debugging. 0 is for suppress all terminal errors, and 1 is for allow terminal errors to show up.
9. PID 39 has three values: CHECK, YES, NO. NO is for assume there is no media upload for that Chatbox, YES assumes there is a valid media upload for that Chatbox, CHECK checks per Chatbox (slower but better)/
10. You can't use PHR-NUL anywhere within the CBauth list.
11. These policies apply to files on this server. Clients hosted by other servers will not be affected by this file. For example, PercentAutoencode will work on clients that support it and are on the Chatbox Engine server.
