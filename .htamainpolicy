Notes:
1. All filepaths must use '/'
2. Boolean values must have YES or NO
3. Only use no-go-phrases if certain words would threaten user security (i.e. script tag)
4. On no-go-phrases, and PID 101 and protect-extensions: use '//' as the delimiter between phrases.
5. PERMS within the CBauth section must be sudo or notsudo, where sudo allows users to run admin commands and perform admin actions. All users in CBauth will be granted a reserved name.
6. RESRICT-TO in FILESAFE has three options: local, sudo and login. local means no writing is allowed through the API, sudo means you have to be a sudo user to write to the file, and login means you just have to log in to write to the file.
7. WHile CBauth needs semicolons at the end of each entry, FILESAFE does not, it just needs '::'.
8. PID 37 is specifically for debugging. 0 is for suppress all terminal errors, and 1 is for allow terminal errors to show up.
9. PID 39 has three values: CHECK, YES, NO. NO is for assume there is no media upload for that Chatbox, YES assumes there is a valid media upload for that Chatbox, CHECK checks per Chatbox (slower but better)/
10. You can't use PHR-NUL anywhere within the CBauth list.
11. These policies apply to files on this server. Clients hosted by other servers will not be affected by this file. For example, PercentAutoencode will work on clients that support it and are on the Chatbox Engine server.
12. Don't use any filesystem protected / conflict characters (such as NUL, >, &, etc.) in any part of the CBauth list.
13. If sendmsgendpoint_cmdchek is NO, then PIDs 65-71 must also be NO.
14. CBAUTH is no longer number dependent. That means no preassigned UID/UKEY
15. Turn PID 89 to char if you intend on using UTF-8 encoded strings all the time

**No no group names: WILDCARD-ALL, sudo, notsudo, local.
Also, the string '//' cannot appear in any group names.

Put users in multiple groups, group names delimited by //.
Users are granted sudo if __any__ of their groups are sudo.**

Make sure to keep secure passwords.

**Use g: to declare that this chatbox is open to only certain groups;
then list the groups with // as delimiter, i.e. g:GROUP1//GROUP2//GROUP3

Using just 'sudo' or 'login' without g: means any group or user that satisifies those
requirements will be granted entry.**
